# OpenStrings
## A platform for string players to share and view fingerings - <https://www.open-strings.com/>
This is a [Yesod](https://www.yesodweb.com/) app running [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) on the frontend. It deploys to heroku using [heroku-buildpack-stack](https://github.com/mfine/heroku-buildpack-stack). To build, run `stack build`. For development, run [ghcid](https://github.com/ndmitchell/ghcid#readme) in the project root and then open the site on (http://127.0.0.1:3001).

### About
This is the implementation of my Master's Thesis at New York University. You can [read the paper here](https://blog.josephmorag.com/OpenStrings_Thesis.pdf) to get a better idea of the motivation behind the project as well as an overview of the implementation and prior art.
